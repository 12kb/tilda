1) Here is the software you'll need installed besides tilda:

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/vte/
http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/
glib >= 2.8

2) unzip and untar the source, change directorys to the tilda dir and run:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

3) Run tilda -C to bring up the configuration wizard, even if you had tilda
installed before, ~/.tilda/config changes all the time.

4) The command 'tilda' runs tilda later

5) Default key F[$instance+1] so if this is first tilda you run, instance=0, press
F1 to bring tilda up and down. Example key bindings:

    None+grave -- ~
    None+F1 -- can be any key instead of F1 as well
    Control+x -- can be any key instead of x as well
    Alt+x -- can be any key instead of x as well
    
Be sure that xbindkeys is not running! If it grabs the same key as you want Tilda to use.

6) tilda -h to see the rest of the command line options. If you want a transparent bg
and you want a white font do the follow "tilda -t -b black" this will set the
forground color to white and the terminal transparent.

7) lock files are stored in ~/.tilda/locks now so keep an eye on that dir if Tilda
dies in an odd way, seg fault or xkill.

8) Shortcuts for tabs are: Ctrl-Shift-T (New Tab), Ctrl-Shift-PageUp (Next Tab),
Ctrl-Shift-PageDown (Prev Tab), Ctrl-Shift-W (Close Tab), Ctrl-Shift-Q (Close Tilda)
