1) Here is the software you'll need installed besides Tilda:

VTE - ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/vte/
libConfuse - http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/
glib >= 2.8
glade >= 2.0

2) Unzip and untar the source, change directory to the Tilda dir and run:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

3) Run "tilda". It will create the default configuration file for you. If you
would like to see the configuration wizard, right click on the Tilda window
and choose "Preferences...".

6) Default keybinding is F[$instance+1] so if this is first Tilda process, then
instance will be 0 (second process, instance will be 1, etc.). For this
example, you would press F1 to bring Tilda up and down.

Some examples of keybinding names:
    grave -- ~
    F1 -- can be any key instead of F1 as well
    Control+x -- can be any key instead of x as well
    Alt+x -- can be any key instead of x as well

6) Run "tilda --help" to see the rest of the command line options.
If you want a transparent background and you want a white font, the following
will give you what you expect: "tilda -t -b black" this will set the
forground color to white and the terminal transparent.

7) Lock files are stored in ~/.tilda/locks now so keep an eye on that dir if Tilda
dies in an odd way, seg fault or xkill. This should not be a problem, as we try
to clean this directory every time Tilda starts.

8) Shortcuts for tabs are: Ctrl-Shift-T (New Tab), Ctrl-Shift-PageUp (Next Tab),
Ctrl-Shift-PageDown (Prev Tab), Ctrl-Shift-W (Close Tab), Ctrl-Shift-Q (Close Tilda)
