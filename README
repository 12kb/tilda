1) Here is the software you'll need installed besides tilda:

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/vte/

2) unzip and untar the source, change directorys to the tilda dir and run:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

3) Run tilda -C to bring up the configuration wizard, even if you had tilda
installed before, ~/.tilda/config changes all the time.

4) tilda runs tilda later

5) Default key F[$instance+1] so if this is first tilda you run, instance=0, press
F1 to bring tilda up and down.

6) tilda -h to see the rest of the command line options. If you want a transparent bg
and you want a white font do the follow "tilda -t -b black" this will set the
forground color to white and the terminal transparent.


ADDED ENV VAR TILDA_NUM SO YOU CAN DO:

tilda -T $TILDA_NUM

inside tilda, maybe set alias exit to that ;) thanks David Escott
