1) Here is the software you'll need installed besides tilda:

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/vte/

http://hocwp.free.fr/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html

2) unzip and untar the source, change directorys to the tilda dir and run:

./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make install

3) Run tilda -C to bring up the configuration wizard, even if you had tilda
installed before, ~/.tilda/config changes all the time.

4) tilda runs tilda later

5) tilda -T N to move the terminal up and down, or use the key you set 
for xbindkeys to use, N is the number correspoding to the tilda running. 
As you start each tilda they increase. So the first tilda running is 
tilda -T 0. When you add keys to the keybinding entry box in the config 
wizrad simply put a comma between the different buttons for different 
tildas, ie F1, F2, F3 will map for tilda -T 0, tilda -T 1 and tilda -T 
2 respectfully. Or set tilda -T N to another key using another 
keybinding software.

6) tilda -h to see the rest of the command line options. If you want a transparent bg
and you want a white font do the follow "tilda -t -b black" this will set the
forground color to white and the terminal transparent.
