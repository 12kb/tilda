New in Tilda-0.7
New right click menu -- can config tilda while its running, everything but the key bind that is.
GOT RID OF XBINDKEYS! Tilda now listens for each key press on its own. See the Readme to setup
a key for the new way of doing things.
Sorry but no longer can you do 'tilda -T $NUM' or any form.
I may add it back later with XTestFakeKey if people really want it so just let me know.
Lots more bug fixes as well of course :).

New in Tilda-0.06
New Config Wizard. Still alittle ugly and doesn't auto update, but I am
saving that for when you can have each tilda instance configured seperatly.

Lots of bug fixes too :). 


################################

Fixed LOTS of buffer overflows. This should also fix some of the GTK problems
we were having.
Changed the config file system, it is much less hackish now.
Changed the way tilda builds a little bit.

New in Tilda-0.05:
Added env var TILDA_NUM which is set to the current tilda num to move it up and
down

New in Tilda-0.03:
Fixed bugs of not completely leaving the screen on some window managers. 
Added many command line options.

tilda -C if you are moving from .02 or before to .03.


New features in Tilda-0.02:
Fixed bugs, hopefully, in writing to configuration files. 
Added options in configuration wizard for devilspie and
