New Translations
================================================================================
We, the Tilda developers, have decided to use Launchpad to assist with our
translation effort. Please use it if you can. It is located at
https://translations.launchpad.net/tilda/trunk/+pots/tilda

We would appreciate if you do translations on Launchpad to save yourself and
others from unneeded effort.


How to integrate a new translation into Tilda
================================================================================
1) Copy the LANG.po file into the po/ directory.
2) Add LANG to the po/LINGUAS file.

The next time you completely rebuild and install Tilda, it will automatically
compile and install the language file onto your system. Afterwards, if you run
Tilda with the correct LANG environmental variable, Tilda should use your
translation.


How to do a new translation without Launchpad
================================================================================
cd po
msginit -l en_US         # (for USA English. Creates en.po)

# ... do the translation in your editor of choice ...

# add your translation to the LINGUAS file, without the .po
# extension.
#
# That would be "en" for the above examples

Then run the following commands:

make update-po
make update-gmo
cd ..
make
