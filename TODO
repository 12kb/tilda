Feature Requests / Improvements
================================================================================
* Multimonitor support (Xinerama, etc)
* Dragable bar at the bottom to change Tilda's height
* Ability to disable keyboard accelerators (close tab, new tab, etc)
* Configurable keyboard accelerators (close tab, new tab, etc)
* Automatically hide tilda when it loses focus (fairly easy)
* Session support, so tilda will load with the same number of tabs that it had
  upon closing
* Ability to rename a tab manually
* Ability to pop up a dialog when the keybinding process fails (EASY now)


Possible Translation Problems
================================================================================
Change "Animation Delay" to "Animation Duration"
"Leaving modifiers unmodified" is unclear
"Notebook" should be changed to "Window", probably
"tab_pos" error msg (in a switch stmt) should be changed.
