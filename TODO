[ ] guy in forum - It works fine on a single desktop, but multimonitor
support would be very much appreciated. In the mean time, perhaps a way
to specify the location on the desktop?

[ ] guy in forum - Optionally, a dragable bar on the bottom of Tilda to
change the height?

irasnyd - make the keyboard shortcuts (accelerators) optional (so you can
turn them off) as well as making them configurable (so you can choose
what key to use.

alefteris (irc) - add a .pot (gettext translation template) file to the
project, so that it will be easier to translate it.

franlever (irc) - I would like to have an option that hides tilda in focus of
another window, like yakuake has. It is annoying when I click on another window,
and then I am not seeing tilda appear, so I press the tilda keybinding, but it hides
in the background, so I must press the tilda keybinding again.

WarzoneCommand (irc) - add a "save tilda session" option, so that if tilda is closed
with two tabs open, it will also be started with two tabs opened.

WarzoneCommand (irc) - add the ability to rename a tab manually.

coNP (irc) - the default key (F1) doesn't work on ubuntu, since it is already bound to help.
Is it possible to prompt for keybinding on first run of tilda, or perhaps check if the keybinding
is already in use during the first run, and prompt only if it /is/ in use?

Markus Nagler (irc) - Change "Animation Delay" to "Animation Duration"

Markus Nagler (irc) - "Leaving modifiers unmodified" is unclear

Markus Nagler (irc) - "Notebook" should be changed to "Window", probably

Markus Nagler (irc) - "tab_pos" error msg (in a switch stmt) should be changed.
